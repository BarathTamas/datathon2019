### About the tool

We  find that transparency is very important, both for companies and governmental organisations. The United Nations is a powerful intergovernmental organisation whose purpose is to maintain international peace and security, develop friendly relations among nations, achieve international co-operation and be a centre for harmonizing the actions of nations. The question we asking is as follows: Does the UN fulfill its purposes, or has it turned to aimless diplomatic courtesy?
