### About our team

We are all first year students of the Master of Statistics here at KU Leuven. The team consists of: Tamas Barath, Atsuki Kojima, Blazej Makosa, Nicola Schwemmle, Pascal Wiltschko.


This is our creation for the 2019 Datathon competition at KU Leuven. It ended up winning "Best Data Visualization".


### About the tool

Transparency is important, so we created a tool to investigate the content of UN addresses.  

Be warned the Shiny app is clunky! The dataset is pretty big [and stored in .csv :')], and we did not really have the time to optimize things. It was also my
first time working with Shiny, and I would do many things differently today. Some of the underlying packages seem to cause some problems with the app
in 2021, so things will have to be updated a bit.
