### About our team

We are all first year students of the Master of Statistics here at KU Leuven. The team consists of: Tamas Barath, Atsuki Kojima, Blazej Makosa, Nicola Schwemmle, Pascal Wiltschko.


This is our creation for the 2019 Datathon competition at KU Leuven. It ended up winning "Best Data Visualization".


### About the tool

Transparency is important, so we created a tool to investigate the content of UN addresses.  

Be warned the Shiny app is clunky! The dataset is pretty big, and we did not really have the time to optimize things. It was also my
first time working with Shiny, and I would do many things differently today. Some of the underlying packages seem to cause some problems with the app
in 2021, so things will have to be updated a bit.
